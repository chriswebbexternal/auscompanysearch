# Company Search

## Implementation Notes

- Create React App used for simplicity
- Company search REST service frequently times out, ABN lookup seems more reliable
- Entirely hooks driven, with useReducer doing the heavy lifting on business logic

## To run

git clone and `npm run start` to kick off, or just [open on codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/chriswebbexternal/auscompanysearch)

run `npm test` for unit tests
